I consider myself a polyglot programmer who enjoys the
challenge of working across many different languages as needed. My ideal job is one that allows me to
utilize modern development methodologies to delivery high quality software while maintaining agility.
Whether a project is end-user focused or deep in a network stack, I enjoy diving deep into a problem
space.
