I am a polyglot programmer who enjoys the challenges of working across many domains and languages as
the problem requires. My ideal job is one that allows me to utilize modern development techniques to
deliver high quality software while maintaining agility and discipline. Whether a project is end-user
focused or buried in a network stack, I enjoy diving into a problem space and delivering creative solutions
that solve the problem with as little complexity as needed.
