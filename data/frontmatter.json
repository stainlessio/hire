  "profile": "I am a highly motivated and creative software engineer who likes to straddle the full stack, from kernel development to enterprise-scale service-oriented systems. My favorite language and strongest current language is Python, but I consider myself a polyglot with strong experience in C++, Java, and Javascript also. I'm currently teaching myself Rust."
